# #PyBank Instructions
# In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
# Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
# * The total number of months included in the dataset
# * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
# * The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
# * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
# * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

#Import os and csv modules
